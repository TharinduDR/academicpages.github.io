Projects
======
* <B>2015</2015> West Nile Virus Prediction – Predicted when and where different species of mosquitos will test positive for West Nile virus 
  given weather, location, testing, and spraying data using an ensemble model of Gradient Boosting Classification Decision trees and Regularized Greedy Forest. Collaborated with Chicago Department of Public Health.

* <B>2015</2015> KDD Cup 2014 - Predicting Excitement at DonorsChoose.org - Identified projects that are exceptionally exciting to the 
  business, at the time of posting using an ensemble model of vowpal wabbit, Random Forests and Extra Trees(goo.gl/CU5RIA)

* <B>2017</2015> Mercedes-Benz Greener Manufacturing - Predicted the time it takes to pass speedier testing given different permutations of 
  Mercedes-Benz car features. Ensemble model of 2 XGBoost models was used for the prediction. PCA and ICA were used since the data set had anonymized features.
