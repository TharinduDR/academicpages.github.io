Hi, ආයුබෝවන්(āyubōvan).

I am a PhD Student at [Research Group in Computational Linguistics (RGCL)](http://rgcl.wlv.ac.uk/) in [University of Wolverhamton (UK)](https://www.wlv.ac.uk/) supervised by [Prof. Ruslan Mitkov](https://www.wlv.ac.uk/research/institutes-and-centres/riilp---research-institute-in-information-and-lan/research-group-of-computational-linguistics/staff-at-rgcl/professor-mitkov/) and [Dr. Constantin Orasan](http://pers-www.wlv.ac.uk/~in6093/). My current research focuses on using Deep Learning for Translation Memories.

I received my bachelors degree from [University of Moratuwa](https://www.mrt.ac.lk/web/), Sri Lanka specializing in Computer Science & Engineering. After graduation, I worked as a Associate Technical Team Lead in R&D division of [CodeGen International](http://www.codegen.co.uk/) where I lead and managed Machine Learning and Data Science Team. I worked on several machine learning projects related to travel domain, such as Personalization and Recommendation, Revenue Management, Review Mining, Chat bots etc. 

I am particulary interested in Deep Learning applications in NLP.
