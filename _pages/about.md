Hi, ආයුබෝවන්  (āyubōvan).

I am Tharindu Ranasinghe, a PhD Student at [RGCL](http://rgcl.wlv.ac.uk/) in [University of Wolverhamton](https://www.wlv.ac.uk/) supervised by [Prof. Ruslan Mitkov](https://www.wlv.ac.uk/research/institutes-and-centres/riilp---research-institute-in-information-and-lan/research-group-of-computational-linguistics/staff-at-rgcl/professor-mitkov/) and [Dr. Constatin Orasan](http://pers-www.wlv.ac.uk/~in6093/). My research is based on using deep learning for translation memories. 

Before starting my PhD, I worked as a Associate Technical Team Lead in RnD Devision of [CodeGen International](http://www.codegen.co.uk/) where I lead and managed Machine Learning and Data Science Team. I worked on several machine learning projects related to travel domain, such as Personalization and Recommendation, Revenue Management and Review Mining etc. 

I am particulary interested in NLP, Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Recommender Systems. Contact me if you would like to be part of exciting projects within my areas of expertise or interested in exploring the use of those technologies to address real-world problems.
