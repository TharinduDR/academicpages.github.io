## Abstract
This  paper  describes  the  system  submit-ted by the RGCL team toGermEval 2019Shared Task 2: Identification of OffensiveLanguage. We experimented with five dif-ferent neural network architectures in or-der to classify Tweets in terms of offensivelanguage.  By means of comparative eval-uation, we select the best performing foreach  of  the  three  subtasks.   Overall,  wedemonstrate that using only minimal pre-processing we are able to obtain competi-tive results.
